    "problem": "The Climbing Clan had a legacy check-in app based off Google Sheets working against a legacy API that was being used for check in purposes at events. Unfortunately this app wasn't mobile optimised, and required computer use to use the Google Apps Script extensions.",
    "approach": "The Clan needed a mobile first application to integrate with WordPress and WooCommerce to allow users to check users in.",
    "solution": "I selected React plus Mantine Framework with a custom built WordPress plugin to extend the existing WordPress API to provide an improved API."
