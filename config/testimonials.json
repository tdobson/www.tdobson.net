    "testimonial": "I was having a server problem, the kind of problem you don't want. Enter Tim — firstly he was; quick getting straight onto the server and diagnosing beyond the hardware and checking the logs and sure enough, he finds the software problem. Beyond that, as that issue was beyond my people, he was able to recommend someone to fix that small issue and within the hour the service was back up. Problem solved. In short, Tim was fast, professional, analytical and problem focussed. He looked beyond his 'job' (hardware) to find the problem (software) and suggest a pragmatic solution to get it fixed (Software freelancer). Initiative squared. Highly recommended.",

He's the friendly, approachable face of what can be quite a daunting world to folks like me from outside the natural world of Linux hosting and sysadminry. I've always felt Tim was happy to chat to me and he's always been full of good ideas both technically in terms of wider business/marketing. I wish him well with his next move.",

Tim is an adventurer and one of the greatest proponents of open source communities and social enterprise.

A while after St George's Healthcare NHS Trust was looking at moving from a Windows based server to a Linux based one as part of a website redevelopment. I immediately got in touch with Tim as not only do Bytemark offer such a great service at such a low price but their support and engagement with clients is excellent. He helped to pull together quotes and to explain the options with my colleague (who had the budget but lacked web server knowledge), this made everything easier for the final decision to be made.",

However, my staff at Shadowcat Systems have also worked with Tim on a professional level and know that Tim is a seriously-clued system administrator. Tim works at Bytemark who have always been a Geek's service provider of choice, part of the reason for this is the quality of the staff they employ and Tim is a fine example of those staff.",

If you are thinking of working with Tim as a client or supporting him, I have absolutely hesitation in telling you it will be a great experience and also fun. Another positive to share he is so aware of cash flow for small businesses and always make sure my invoices are paid on time. I highly recommend Tim as a great business innovator.",

As freelancers, I look forward to seeing Him on the Manchester business circuit in addition to seeing his business flourish.",
