A while after St George's Healthcare NHS Trust was looking at moving from a Windows based server to a Linux based one as part of a website redevelopment. I immediately got in touch with Tim as not only do Bytemark offer such a great service at such a low price but their support and engagement with clients is excellent. He helped to pull together quotes and to explain the options with my colleague (who had the budget but lacked web server knowledge), this made everything easier for the final decision to be made.",
