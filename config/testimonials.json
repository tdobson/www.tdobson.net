    "testimonial": "I was having a server problem, the kind of problem you don't want. Enter Tim — firstly he was; quick getting straight onto the server and diagnosing beyond the hardware and checking the logs and sure enough, he finds the software problem. Beyond that, as that issue was beyond my people, he was able to recommend someone to fix that small issue and within the hour the service was back up. Problem solved. In short, Tim was fast, professional, analytical and problem focussed. He looked beyond his 'job' (hardware) to find the problem (software) and suggest a pragmatic solution to get it fixed (Software freelancer). Initiative squared. Highly recommended.",

Tim is extremely knowledgeable not only technically but also brilliant at Business Development. He is more than happy to share his experience and ways of working with others and I have learned from him. If you are thinking of working with Tim as a client or supporting him, I have absolutely hesitation in telling you it will be a great experience and also fun. Another positive to share he is so aware of cash flow for small businesses and always make sure my invoices are paid on time. I highly recommend Tim as a great business innovator.",

    "testimonial": "I’ve been on Tim’s outer circle for a number of years, but met him properly when he was a team member of a client of mine when I worked on-site for 12 months. Tim’s role was 100% client-facing and he excelled at this. Extremely customer-focused, he was considerate and treated clients with the utmost integrity and professionalism. It’s pleasing to see Tim has gone freelance. Be aware that anybody who works with Tim will receive nothing but the best service and attentiveness. As freelancers, I look forward to seeing Him on the Manchester business circuit in addition to seeing his business flourish.",

This makes him a perfect fit anywhere along the spectrum from sales to engineering. This made Tim great to work with. He could manage customer expectations and changing needs allowing me to focus on what needed to be done. Don't trust him to play fair at Bzflag though.",

I've always felt Tim was happy to chat to me and he's always been full of good ideas both technically in terms of wider business/marketing. I wish him well with his next move.",

  server to a Linux based one as part of a website redevelopment. I immediately got in touch with Tim as not only do Bytemark offer such a great service at such a low price but their support and engagement with clients is excellent.
  He helped to pull together quotes and to explain the options with my colleague (who had the budget but lacked web server knowledge), this made everything easier for the final decision to be made.",
