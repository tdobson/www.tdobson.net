                  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the chair of The Climbing Clan and The Caving Crew, BMC and BCA affiliated climbing and caving clubs that I founded. Through my work with these clubs, I've developed several software products to assist with club operations. Most notably, I've created neoClan, a second-generation membership check-in system.
